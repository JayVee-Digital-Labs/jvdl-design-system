## What is a Design System?

A design system is a collection of reusable components, guided by clear standards, that can be assembled together to build any number of applications. It ensures consistency and efficiency in design and development by providing a shared language and set of principles for teams to follow. In this project, the design system is implemented using React, Next.js, and Storybook, providing a robust and scalable solution for building UI components.

## How to Use

### Installation

To get started, install the package from npm:

```sh
npm install jvdl-design-system
```

### Importing Styles

In your project, open the app.tx, _app.js_app.tsx, or equivilent add import the compiled CSS

```ts
// Your top level App
import '@jayvee-digital-labs/design-system/dist/styles/index.css';
```

### Using Components

After importing the styles, you can use the provided components anywhere in your app:

```ts
// filepath: /path/to/your-nextjs-app/pages/index.tsx
import { Heading } from '@jayvee-digital-labs/dessign-system';

export default function Home() {
  return <Heading level={2}>Hello from JVDL Design System!</Heading>;
}
```

### Component Props

Most components come with their exported component props. You can refer to the documentation for each component to see the available props and how to use them. Here is an example using the `Heading` component:

```ts
import { Heading } from '@jayvee-digital-labs/design-system';

export default function Home() {
  return <Heading level={2} color="primary">Hello from JVDL Design System!</Heading>;
}
